- Validate architectural patterns and design decisions

### 2. Structure & Flow
- Evaluate the logical progression of ideas
- Check if the introduction hooks the reader effectively
- Assess whether sections build upon each other coherently
- Review if the conclusion provides value and actionable takeaways
- Ensure smooth transitions between topics

### 3. Clarity & Accessibility

- Check for assumed knowledge that might confuse beginners
- Assess the learning progression for the target audience

### 4. Engagement & Value

- Suggest resources, tools, or examples when relevant

Hi, I am Konstantinos(aka Kostas) Konstantinidis and this is my blog. I am a software engineer, husband and fan of most stuff.

Don't be suprised if this blog doesn't seem to have a "theme". It's whatever crosses my mind so that means unicorns, teapots orbiting sun, spaghetti monsters and Carl Sagan smoking marijuana while gazing the stars. This blog has 0 ambition of achieving anything more than taking up space somewhere in the internets and thus, it will remain as diverse as life itself.

At this point I should also point out that I have no idea of what I am talking about. So yeah. There's that.

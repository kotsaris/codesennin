Hi, I am Konstantinos(aka Kostas) Konstantinidis and this is my blog.

I am a software engineer, husband to a wonderful wife and father of 2 girls(4, 7).
I am also a cofounder of [Ardanis.com](https://www.ardanis.com).

I graduated from City College, Thessaloniki with a Bachelor in Computer Science awarded by the University of Sheffield on 2004.

I moved to Ireland on 2011 and worked there for while before cofounding [Ardanis](https://www.ardanis.com) back on 2016. I work there currently.
Recently I decided to move back to Greece since I have been heavily working remotely for the past years and after 11 years in Ireland.

I am in the process of starting a company in Greece and I am documenting some of the steps of repatriation and company creation here in Greece as I found many people interested in this journey.
If you are interested then make sure to follow this blog and the twitter acccount. I may be posting some jobs as well in 2023.

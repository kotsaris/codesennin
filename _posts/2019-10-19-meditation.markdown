# My experience 

Two years ago, I decided to try meditation as a way to reduce my anxiety. Eventhough I tried to look into it by myself, the [Headspace](https://headspace.com) application helped me ease into it much better. I realized after following Andy's(The founder) guidance that Mindfulness and meditation has many more benefits rather than just anxiety-reducing ones. 


About 2 months in, with daily 10 minute sessions I saw my first results. A noticeable reduction in anxiety. A year later, a much bigger improvement. Nowadays, I am basically a different person than the one from mid-2017. Stress and anxiety is managed better. Anger is noticed way in advance and I decide whether or not to vent/release it. My focus and my ability to "get in the zone" has also become better. 

There are a number of ways to perceive Meditation as. Personally, I see it as my mind's workout and hygiene sessions. If my fitness needs time to keep up then why not my mind?

If you haven't heard of meditation before, don't be intimidated by it. You just sit still for at least 10 minutes and be mindful of certain things such as your breath(in a nutshell). Andy will give you advice in the form of "homework" that you need to follow on each day depending on the pack that you are completing. Each pack deals with a different area eg anxiety, stress, grief, focus etc. You need to meditate at least 3 times per week to get the benefits though.

If you happen to try it let me know of your experience with it. Finally, if you have any questions just message me and I am happy to help.

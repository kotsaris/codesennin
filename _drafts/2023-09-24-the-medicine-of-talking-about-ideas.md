# One discussion about an idea a day, makes the psychologist go away.
_I started writing this back in January 2023. For whatever reason, I didn't publish it back then._

Let me talk to you about the importance of ideas, to me anyways.

At a friend's house yesterday, a very educated person, chatting about ideas. It's deeply fulfilling to be in a place where people meet ad-hoc to have a coffee and speak about philosophy, technology, religion and other topics that personally find to be almost food for the soul.

While I was living abroad, despite my best efforts, I couldn't help but notice that I couldn't easily expand my social circle substantially. Even then, the protocol to meet another person for coffee involved letting them know well in advance. This, to my mediterranean - hey let's go for a coffee now! - brain seemed bizarre.

To be entirely honest, I wasn't very satisfied not being in a position to regularly meet people and talk about ideas. The family was a great core but an auxiliary layer of friends and family to talk to is very good for the soul, IMO.

At some point, I came across Mrs. Marvelous, an amazing series on Amazon Prime. This American Jewish family living in the 1950/60s, with the daughter, a pioneer female upcoming standup comedian, the father, an intellectual teaching at a university, and the mother, a fashionable mother.

They all seem to be living in New York, in a very nice apartment, until the mother decides to leave and stay in Paris for a while. Her husband, the mathematician takes a short of sabbatical and goes after her to try and get her back in New York and the family.

At some point, after a few months have passed, the series shows Mrs. Marvelous going to Paris to try to get them to return(if memory serves). If you ask me, tell me of all the things that are going into the reasons and stimulants which gave you the idea to return to Greece, this next scene is in there.

The scene is about the mathematician, in a cafÃ© in Paris, with other intellectuals in a heated argument and banter which you see that they enjoy, despite the intensity. Life in Greece involves a lot of that. These discussions happen in Taverns, late at night, or in the Kafeneia(traditional coffee places) and, like yesterday, at home visits. So, in essence, this scene made me a bit envious about the things I lost, while abroad, things that I had before. And I wanted them back.

It wasn't that this mathematician didn't have intellectuals in New York to meet and chat, I think the point the series was making was that some countries have a bigger cultural element that leads to these meetings/rituals and a tendency to talk about ideas which you genuinely find interesting and act as a mental vitamin for your brain.

Ever since I returned, I had many discussions like these. They can occur over pizza, coffee, a tavern feast or elsewhere. And I can tell that they contribute to my mental well being. There's probably some literature about this in terms of Psychology which I am not familiar with ðŸ˜‚.

_More recent thoughts_
Large language models, despite being very recent as a technology and a lot of times as dull as a block of wood, offer opportunities for ideas and exploration. I thought it would be good to mention this here as I have started using it increasingily to explore ideas and see if the AI helps me in any way learn something or just to explore.

As I finish the implementation of yet another feature with the help of Claude Code and without 
having to write a single line of code nor tests I am reminded once more of how fast our profession is changing.
What you know today, may become out of date by the next month. Looking at the skill level of engineers out there there's 
a very wide spectrum of AI literacy and AI-coding assistance expertise. 

Starting from the developer who may refuse to use any AI tools at all, to the one who crawls Hacker News for the latest
developments to this particular area. Do you remember when someone had Visual Studio in their CV as a skill worth 
making the interviewer aware of? I do. It was a big deal back then. It meant you didn't rely on Notepade to write your code,
it meant that you were efficient at your craft.

Got the analogy yet? Maybe let me try to drive it home.

A few years ago, Github Copilot came out. It was an interesting tool and it slowly captured a good portion of the market.
To this day, there are developers who rely solely on Copilot. You can say that an evolution of this is ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok prompting.
Perhaps, a successor to Stackoverflow. Here's my problem, BLAH, give me the solution. Amazing. Once you get hooked to that,
if you are curious enough, you might be wondering, OK, but how can I apply to this a codebase? How can I skip the back and forth to my browser
and the inherent curse of being a clip board jockey?

Then, you may enter the agentic world and use Claude Code or a similar tool. But even then, there's is depth. 
Depth that is increasing by the day. From MCP  tooling that you can hook up to it, to agenting personas you can create
and leverage to do separate tasks ... and so on.

The point is, if you are not keeping up with the latest developments in this area, you may find yourself left behind.

## Getting Started

If you're looking to dive deeper into agentic coding tools, I recommend starting with [Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding Assistant](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant/) from DeepLearning.AI. This course provides hands-on experience with the tool I mentioned and covers the fundamentals of working with AI coding assistants.

For advanced usage tips and techniques, check out [this comprehensive guide](https://harper.blog/2025/05/08/basic-claude-code/) that covers more sophisticated workflows and best practices.

So do try to keep up. It's a brave new world, and it's moving fast.

# Trichotomy of control.

My job as a Software Engineer and Consultant is many times to join a project which is in a dire situation. A while back, I joined a project that couldn't find success two years into development, and I was tasked to turn it around.

In other cases, I may join a project that has a very tight deadline. A seemingly impossible goal.

In the old days, before being exposed to Mindfulness and Stoicism that is, I'd be pretty stressed. Learning about Stoicism, equipped me with a very powerful way of thinking about situations

That's the Trichotomy of Control and it was Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher who lived in the first second century CE.

He described this idea of control in his Enchiridion(or "Manual"). He emphasized that it's important to distinguish between things that are within our control and things that are not.

1. Things we control completely. Your thoughts, beliefs and actions.
2. Things we cannot control at all. External events, actions of others, etc.
3. Things we can influence but not control completely. Our health, relationships, and other aspects that involve some interation with the outside world.

It's important to note that Epictetus coined it as a Dichotomy(1 and 2) but modern interpretations have extended this to a Trichotomy. I personally find the Trichotomy version handy.

This way of thinking about things and situations gives focus and relief. You no longer have to focus on the success of your undertaking if it's not completely within your control. What you can do instead, is focus on your actions.

What actions can you take on a daily basis to make success more probable? Did you do that? Great. Then relax, there's nothing else to do. Being stressed is just noise, and you are trying to get into the business of maximizing signal.

The success of a difficult undertaking is in those things that is partially within your control. This doesn't mean of course that you won't be giving it your best. The trap you need to avoid though is the temptation to _hope for the best_. You won't hope for anything.

>If it worked 🤷🏻‍♂️.

>If it didn't 🤷🏻‍♂️.

If your brain asks you whether or not this challenge is going to be a success then give it The Farmer and His Horse answer. [Maybe, we'll see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmYG0LIznkk).

Hopefully you found this entry useful. If you'd like more Stoicism consider sharing this.

# Introduction

It's been 9 years since I co-founded [Ardanis Technologies Limited](https://ardanis.com), a software consulting company 
based in Dublin, Ireland. This blog post reflects on the lessons I've learned during this journey. 
From the (actual) basement, to a multi-country company, to [winning a nation-wide technology award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ardanis-technologies-limited_technology-awards-techconsulting-activity-7132347034887417856-0yto/),
this is my first part in the lessons learned from my journey with the company.
I hope they may offer insight for you if you're considering starting your own business.

> It takes an opportunity to reveal itself, and a leap of faith to take it.

As a technologist in Ireland at the time, the appeal of working for Big Tech or prominent and promising startups was strong.
Some people may have considered the idea of relinquishing that dream to start their own company as foolish. 
However, I saw it as an opportunity to create something that expressed my own values as a software craftsman. 

# Lesson 1: The Importance of a Shared Vision

When co-founding a company, it's crucial that all founders share a common vision and values. This alignment creates 
a long-term foundation that will hold against the inevitable challenges of entrepreneurship. It was definetely a journey
that presented its troughts and peaks, but having a shared vision helped us navigate them together. The premise that 
there were clients out there that appreciated our approach to software development and would pay for it was a strong motivator.

We were not looking to do a quick and dirty job but rather to build long-term relationships with clients who valued quality and craftsmanship.
Our network understood who we were and what we stood for and as such, it was our best marketing tool. Our work for the most 
part guaranteed the long engagements and growth opportunities within existing and new clients.

# Lesson 2: The power of honesty

The world is ridden with people trying to sell you something. Whether it's a product, a service, or an idea, but to me,
and how we endeavoured to run the company, was through honesty and straight talking. This of course, may have lost us some
but it definitely won us more. This is the second contrast that I observed versus the competition. Being honest, and delivering
rather than over-promising and under-delivering. A key thing to remember though was the scale. Of course we dreamed of 
growing big, but personally, I was a bit romantic as well, subscribing to the ideas of the David Heinemeier Hansson's that
you don't need a big company to sustain yourself but also make it meaningful to yourself and your mission in this world.

# Lesson 3: The value of people

Find the right people, hire them, and then get the **fuck** out of their way. This was my motto, and it will stay like so
forever. This of course, does not mean leaving people to their own devices without support, but rather, building what's known as a pit of success,
and letting them thrive while providing all the support they need. 
Hiring was difficult to say the least, partly due to our mission to find people aligned with our values. Remember
when I said that we were software craftsmen? Remember the honesty bit? Finding people aligned with your values can be hard.
But the opposite is even harder. Hiring a lot of people that is and then trying to micromanage them or trying to get rid of them
can be damaging to the existing people(attrition) and of course to the company.

And no, this doesn't mean finding them mythic coding superstars, but finding the raw material, as you can figure out the rest
later on. 


# Lesson 4: Treating people like people

Focus on outcomes, not what people is doing every minute of their working schedule. Have a real-life obligation? Just let
your team know and I'll trust you to cover up the lost hours. Treating people like adults and never forgetting that their
life doesn't begin and end with work is a key factor in ensuring a happy and productive team. Creativity and motivation
to do great work comes from a happy and fulfilled person.

# Lesson 5: Rapport and Culture

Remote work plays a big role in the modern workplace. This typically leaves a big gap for water cooler talk and rapport. 
Remote teams typically miss that glue that a lot of times brings people together so they can speak to each other with 
empathy, honesty and understanding. A tool that I've used for many years was Friday gaming sessions. Just an hour to come
together and play some games. Nothing fancy, just some light-hearted fun. This was a great way to break the ice and get to know
each other on a more personal level.

# Conclusion

These are some of the lessons that I wanted to share with you today. I think there will be more that I will share in the future, so
I'll split this blog post in parts. I hope you found it useful and if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me.

# Introduction

It's been three years since I made the decision to return back to Greece with my family from a twelve year stint in Ireland.

When I decided to return I wasn't sure what the future might hold for me and my family. I was confident in my skills to continue to put bread on the table and
to do that remotely but I wasn't so sure as to how I'd like Greece after a dozen years. This blog goes through my experience these past three years.

The good, the bad and the ugly.

# Work

For the first two years I was working in the company I co-founded back in 2016 and that went well till I had to move on last year. Unfortunately I can't delve into the details of that
but suffice to say that I had to look for work and do that late-summer which was basically a dead market. That was a bit scary initially cause of course, everyone was in holidays
but I decided to start early, prepare my CV and test the waters. A week or two later I had my first leads for remote architecture work. The pay wasn't that great though so I decided to keep looking.

There's a few shops I noticed right away(although, I was also told about those), that despite working for USA companies were trying to low-ball me. The benefit of working in my own company for so long was that I knew
the rate for people like me at a European remote working level. I also knew the ball park they were looking to charge me to other companies. So I passed on those offers.

There were also some quite interesting well paying leads for remote work in Ireland. Finally, I had many friends and ex-colleagues reach out and offer to recommend me for work. I found that very comforting and a confirmation that when you do good deeds, good deeds then happen to you.

What I didn't anticipate though was being approached by Greek companies. I was skeptical at first since I only heard bad experiences from public opinion about the culture in Greek workplaces. In the end, I decided to give it a go and see what happens. Early October, I had two decent offers so I proceeded and got hired as a Technical Director for ATCOM. I liked the people during the interview and the gig was in a domain I haven't worked before (Airlines travel). I felt that compared to the other shop who made the offer, I would be able to drive meaningful change in ATCOM.

The bottom line with remote work from Greece is that indeed, many shops will have you work remotely. The only caveat is that if you are junior, the odds will be against you and you might be required to be in an office.

# School

One of my problems with leaving abroad was education but more concretely, our kids knowing more about our Greek culture, language and history. I am happy to say that education has been one of these topics that didn't cause me much trouble. We are sending the kids to an excellent school and we are very pleased with the results so far. The kids are also loving it and they have a social circle that contributes to their happiness.

# Health

Another area that is noticeably better imo versus my experience in Ireland. The abundance of doctors and the ability to locate a great doctor without going through a GP has been a blessing. We had to do not one, but two operations since returning and both were done in excellent private hospitals in Thessaloniki by excellent surgeons. Having a peadiatricians that is constantly looking at your kid is also something that might strike someone living in Ireland as odd, since the GP is the Α and the Ω in that system, but in Greece, we are large. We can afford a peadiatrician for our kids, and not just me, pretty much most people who have children.

# About Olympus

Since returning, and during my morning routines of going to the gym, the mountain has been calling 😂. So I went on a few hikes to it. I even [summited it](https://www.codesennin.com/archive/2024/11/03/why-did-you-return/). So now, the ritual is pretty specific. Every year, a hike to the top, an overnight stay, and a visit to the twelve gods.

# About Friends and Family

Since I returned to Greece, my anxiety and panic attacks have completely disappeared. At times, I am wondering if the words of Jordan Peterson are correct(an idea also expressed in Stoicism, but also from Freud and Jung) whereby, if you don't live in accordance with your inner voice(or self), then psychological problems may arise from that inner tension.

We live close to both of our parents, to brothers and sisters, but also to good friends. Humans are wired for tribal belonging. So I think that this definetly helped.

# Lifestyle

I suppose, there's little to put in this section that you can't guess.

An abudance of sun 🌞 and 🏖️ can contribute to one's happiness.

Who knew?!

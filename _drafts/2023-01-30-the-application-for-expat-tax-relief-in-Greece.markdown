## Intro
This is another blog in the series of returning to Greece and setting up a company. In this part I'll explore and document my experience as an expat returning to Greece after 10+ years and applying to [Αρθρο 5Γ](https://taxblock.gr/forologikos-odigos/diadikasia-kai-proypotheseis-ypagogis-stis-diataxeis-toy-arthrou-5g/) tax relief. If you don't know what this is, it's basically a 50% tax reduction for 7 years(as of this writing). 

## Prerequisites
If you have been away for more than 5 years and not getting taxed in Greece then you can avail for this. You'll need documentation from the revenue abroad or other means of proving that you were actually a tax resident of another country. In my case I exported my tax certificates and P60s(employeement income details) for the past 5 years.

## First step
In order to kick off the proces I've asked my accountant to handle the application. I've sent him the documents which were in English and he made the application withe the necessary attachments.

The first problem we encountered is that they asked for the documents to be officially translated. I located a certified/recognized by the state tranlsator in my area and asked her to translate the docs. It was about 20 pages so that was a cost.

Once I received the translated documents, I scanned them and sent them to my accountant to upload them again. The next day the revenue messaged us to tell us that the application is going to the next phase.

Another thing they ask you to submit is a signed statement(υπεύθυνη δήλωση) to state that for the next 2 years you will remain a tax resident of Greece. This was easily done via GoV.gr so I forwarded the PDF to my accountant to attach to the application.
